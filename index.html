However, these methods typically bake illumination into their representations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene editing. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. We further introduce a learned per-Gaussian consistency parameter that helps resolve view-dependent artifacts by quantifying the reliability of screen-space approximations across different viewpoints. Our method achieves realistic global illumination effects while preserving the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D Gaussians. The screen-space approximation we utilize allows for dynamic indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and editing."><title>GS-SSR: 3D Gaussian Inverse Rendering with Approximated Global Illumination</title><script defer="defer" src="/gs-ssr/static/js/main.c8a2ef6c.js"></script><link href="/gs-ssr/static/css/main.7dde3f55.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
